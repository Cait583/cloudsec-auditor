CloudSec Auditor
Hybrid Cloud Security Assessment Tool in Python

Description
CloudSec Auditor is a single-file Python project designed to simulate and optionally perform real cloud security audits.
This can run offline in Mock Mode for connecting to the cloud environments (AWS, Azure, GCP) or in Live Mode if the user provides their own credentials.

Features
Mock Mode: Simulates security audits using built-in mock data â€” no cloud account required.

Live Mode: Connects to AWS, Azure, or GCP to perform real security checks if credentials are provided.

Identity Management Checks: Reviews MFA status, inactive accounts, and privilege assignments.

Network Security Review: Inspects firewall rules, open ports, and public exposure.

Log & Monitoring Analysis: Detects gaps in logging and alert coverage.

Threat Intelligence Matching: Compares configurations against known cloud attack techniques.

Risk Scoring: Generates a security score based on industry standards like CIS Benchmarks and NIST CSF.

Reporting: Outputs results to a text or PDF file with recommendations.

Requirements
Python 3.8+

Packages (only needed for Live Mode):

bash
Copy
Edit
boto3
azure-identity
azure-mgmt-resource
google-cloud-storage
reportlab  # for PDF reports
rich       # for nice CLI output


Installation:
Clone the repository

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cloudsec-auditor.git
cd cloudsec-auditor
Install dependencies (optional for Live Mode)

bash

Usage
Mock Mode (default, safe to run)

bash
Copy
Edit
python cloudsec_auditor.py --provider mock --output report.txt
Live Mode

bash
Copy
Edit
python cloudsec_auditor.py --provider aws --output aws_report.txt
(Requires AWS credentials configured via AWS CLI or environment variables)
